The Rules for *The Settlers of Catan:

Objective of the Game:
The goal of The Settlers of Catan is to be the first player to reach 10 victory points by building settlements, cities, roads, and acquiring special development cards.

Setup
1. Game Board: 
   - The board consists of 19 hexagonal tiles representing different terrain types:  
     - Hills (brick), Forests (wood), Mountains (ore), Fields (wheat), Pasture (sheep), and Desert (no resource).  
   - Each hex (except the desert) gets a number token (2-12) determining dice roll probabilities.
   - Players place their initial settlements and roads before the game begins.

2. Starting Positions: 
   - Each player places one settlement and one road.
   - Then, in reverse order, each player places a second settlement and road.
   - The second settlement grants initial resource cards based on adjacent hexes.

Turn Structure
On each turn, a player follows these steps:

1. Roll the Dice (2 six-sided dice) 
   - All players collect resources from hexagonal tiles matching the rolled number.
   - If a player has a settlement adjacent to a hexagonal tile with that number, they gain 1 resource. If they have a city, they gain 2 resources.

2. Trade Resources 
   - Players may trade resources with each other.  
   - Players can also trade with the bank at a 4:1 ratio or better using harbor trading (e.g., 3:1 or 2:1 for certain resources if they have a harbor).

3. Build Structures or Buy Development Cards
   Players may spend resources to:
   - Build a Road (1 wood, 1 brick)
   - Build a Settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
   - Upgrade a Settlement to a City (2 wheat, 3 ore)

4. Move the Robber (if a 7 is rolled)
   - No one collects resources.
   - Any player with 8+ resource cards must discard half
   - The active player moves the **Robber** to any hex and **steals** a resource from a player adjacent to that hex. The blocked hex **does not produce resources** until the Robber is moved.
